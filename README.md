Azure-OpenAI-GPT-4-Integration
This project is a Python script that integrates Azure ML Workspace with OpenAI's GPT-4 engine. It reads a dataset from Azure Blob Storage, converts it into a pandas DataFrame, and then utilizes GPT-4 for natural language processing tasks.

# Why This Project is Important
As organizations handle increasingly large volumes of data, the ability to analyze and make sense of this data in natural language becomes invaluable. This project demonstrates how OpenAI's GPT-4 engine can be used in conjunction with Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure to analyze a large dataset in natural language format. The use of the GPT-4 engine makes this project particularly relevant, as it provides state-of-the-art language understanding capabilities.

# Prerequisites
An Azure subscription
An OpenAI API key
A configured Azure ML Workspace
Python 3.6 or later
Required Python packages: azureml-core, pandas, openai, rich
Getting Started
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/username/Azure-OpenAI-GPT-4-Integration.git (replace username with your GitHub username)

Install the required Python packages: pip install azureml-core pandas openai rich

Replace the placeholders in the Python script with your Azure subscription ID, resource group, workspace name, datastore name, Blob Storage account name and access key, and your OpenAI API key.

Run the Python script: python openai_azure.py

When prompted, enter your query in natural language.

The script will then process the dataset and provide a response based on your query using the GPT-4 engine.
